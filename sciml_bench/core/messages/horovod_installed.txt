********************* Horovod Installation *********************
Horovod is required by one or some of the selected benchmarks
for distributed learning. It has been installed but does not
satisfy the new requirements from the selected benchmarks.
Horovod has to be re-installed.

Based on the selected benchmarks and the existing Horovod build,
the suggested command line to re-install Horovod is

$ HOROVOD_CMD_STR

You should choose "NO" if
1) you want to install Horovod with more environment variables
(e.g., HOROVOD_GPU_OPERATIONS, HOROVOD_WITH_MPI, etc.). See here
for a guidance of all Horovod environment variables:
https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_include.html;
2) you do not want to UNINSTALL the existing Horovod build.
