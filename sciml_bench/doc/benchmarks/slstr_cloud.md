Estimation of sea surface temperature (SST) from space-borne sensors, such as satellites, is crucial for a number of applications in environmental sciences. One of the aspects that underpins the derivation of SST is cloud screening, which is a step that marks each and every pixel of thousands of satellite imageries as containing cloud or clear sky, historically performed using either thresholding or Bayesian methods. This benchmark focuses on using a machine learning-based model for masking clouds, in the Sentinel-3 satellite, which carries the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument. More specifically, the benchmark operates on multispectral image data. The baseline implementation is a variation of the U-Net deep neural network. 


* Main Domain: Environmental Sciences
* Sub Domain: Atmospheric Physics / Remote Sensing
* Task:	Image classification (at pixel level)
* Relevant Datasets: cloud_slstr_ds1
* Authors: Samuel Jackson, Caroline Cox, Jeyan Thiyagalingam, and Tony Hey
