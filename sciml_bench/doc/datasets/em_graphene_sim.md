# em_graphene_sim

em_graphene_sim is dataset from material sciences domain, specifically
from electron microscopes. The dataset is made of pairs of noised and
clean electron micrographs. The clean micrographs were generated by
simulating electron microscope images, using atomic coordinates from
molecular dynamics simulations and the MULTEM code. To simulate the
non-homogeneous noise of high-rate EM we scale across the image
according to a beam profile, before adding Poisson noise and finally
including a selection of random dead pixels. Other details are:

* Data Source: Simulated
* Domain: Material Sciences
* Sub-Domain: Condensed Matter
* Data Type: Images [256 x 256 x 1]
* Data Size: 5GB
