# Summary of Datasets 

This version of the suite includes six datasets, namely: 

1. *[em_graphene_sim](./em_graphene_sim.md)*,
1. *[dms_sim](./dms_sim.md)*,
1. *[cloud_slstr_ds1](./cloud_slstr_ds1.md)*, 
1. *[cloud_slstr_ds2](./cloud_slstr_ds2.md)*, 
1. *[optical_damage_ds1](./optical_damage_ds1.md)*, 
1. *[stemdl_ds1](./stemdl_ds1.md)*, and
1. *[hydronet_ds1](./hydronet_ds1.md)*.


The full details of these datasets, such as domain-level details and enclosing benchmarks, can be found by clicking the respective hyperlinks above. These datasets should be available on systems where the enclosing benchmarks are run.  Exact dependencies of the benchmark on these datasets can be found in the Configuration file.
